# Active Context: ReAct Agent Backend

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on initializing the memory bank for the ReAct Agent Backend project. This is a critical first step to establish comprehensive documentation that will serve as the foundation for all future work on the project.

### Memory Bank Initialization
- Creating core documentation files
- Establishing project understanding
- Documenting system architecture and patterns
- Capturing technical context and constraints

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial memory bank setup, there are no previous changes to document. This represents the baseline state of the project as understood from the initial code analysis.

## Current State Assessment

### Implemented Features
- FastAPI backend with REST endpoints
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming logs and results
- Session management for multiple concurrent users
- Tool safety layer for hosted environments
- Basic authentication for internal team use
- Simple web-based chat interface
- Deployment configurations for Heroku and Vercel

### Architecture Components
- Session Manager for handling user sessions
- Flow Factory for creating and managing agent flows
- Multiple agent types (Manus, Planning, React, SWE, Toolcall)
- Tool Manager for applying safety restrictions
- Various tool implementations for different capabilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete memory bank initialization
   - Finalize progress.md to document current project status
   - Create .clinerules file to capture project-specific patterns
   - Review all memory bank files for completeness and accuracy

### Short-term Priorities
1. Explore the codebase in more depth
   - Examine agent implementations in detail
   - Review tool implementations and safety mechanisms
   - Understand flow execution patterns

2. Identify potential improvements
   - Look for code optimization opportunities
   - Consider additional safety measures
   - Evaluate error handling robustness

3. Document specific components
   - Create detailed documentation for key subsystems
   - Document API endpoints and parameters
   - Create usage examples for different integration scenarios

### Medium-term Goals
1. Enhance the web interface
   - Improve user experience
   - Add more interactive features
   - Implement better visualization of agent thinking

2. Extend tool capabilities
   - Add new tool types
   - Improve existing tool implementations
   - Enhance tool safety mechanisms

3. Improve deployment options
   - Add Docker containerization
   - Create Kubernetes deployment configurations
   - Document cloud-specific deployment patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Create comprehensive memory bank documentation
- **Rationale**: Establish clear understanding of the project for future work
- **Impact**: Enables effective development and maintenance

### Architecture Understanding
- **Consideration**: Need to fully understand the layered architecture
- **Approach**: Document component relationships and interactions
- **Next Action**: Analyze code to verify architectural assumptions

### Tool Safety Approach
- **Consideration**: Understanding how tool safety is implemented
- **Questions**:
  - How are tools restricted in production vs. development?
  - What specific safety measures are applied to each tool type?
  - How is the environment determined and configured?

### Session Management
- **Consideration**: How sessions are managed and cleaned up
- **Questions**:
  - What is the session timeout mechanism?
  - How are resources released when sessions expire?
  - What happens to active connections when sessions are cleaned up?

### Authentication Security
- **Consideration**: Basic authentication may not be sufficient for all deployments
- **Potential Enhancement**: Consider additional authentication options
- **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs. security requirements

## Open Questions

1. What is the expected scale of deployment (users, concurrent sessions)?
2. Are there specific performance benchmarks or requirements?
3. What is the expected integration pattern for most clients?
4. Are there plans to support additional LLM providers beyond Anthropic?
5. How is monitoring and observability handled in production?
