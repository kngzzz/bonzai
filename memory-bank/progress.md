# Progress: ReAct Agent Backend

## Current Status

The ReAct Agent Backend is in a functional state with core features implemented. The system provides a working backend for hosting ReAct Agents as a web service with both REST API and WebSocket interfaces.

### Development Status: **Functional Prototype**

The current implementation represents a functional prototype that demonstrates the core capabilities of the system. It is suitable for internal testing and development but may require additional refinement for production use at scale.

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ FastAPI backend with REST API endpoints
- ✅ WebSocket support for real-time communication
- ✅ Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming logs and results
- ✅ Basic authentication for internal team use
- ✅ Simple web-based chat interface

### Session Management
- ✅ Creation and tracking of user sessions
- ✅ Session timeout and cleanup
- ✅ Message history within sessions
- ✅ Concurrent session support

### Agent System
- ✅ Integration with existing ReAct Agent framework
- ✅ Multiple agent types (Manus, Planning, React, SWE, Toolcall)
- ✅ Flow Factory for creating appropriate flows
- ✅ Agent state management and execution

### Tool System
- ✅ Tool Manager for configuring tools based on environment
- ✅ Tool safety layer for hosted environments
- ✅ Various tool implementations:
  - ✅ Bash command execution
  - ✅ Browser interaction
  - ✅ File operations
  - ✅ Google search
  - ✅ Python code execution
  - ✅ Terminal interaction

### Deployment
- ✅ Configuration for Heroku deployment
- ✅ Configuration for Vercel deployment
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Convenience scripts for local development

## Known Issues

### Session Management
- Session data is stored in memory, which means:
  - Sessions are lost on server restart
  - Not suitable for horizontal scaling without additional session storage
  - Potential memory leaks if session cleanup fails

### Authentication
- Basic authentication is simple but has limitations:
  - Credentials sent with every request
  - No support for token expiration
  - Limited to a single set of credentials

### Tool Safety
- Current safety mechanisms may not cover all edge cases:
  - Some tools may still have potential security implications
  - Environment-based restrictions may need refinement
  - Additional sandboxing may be required for certain tools

### Error Handling
- Some error scenarios may not be handled gracefully:
  - Network interruptions during streaming
  - LLM API failures
  - Concurrent modification of shared resources

### Performance
- Performance under high load has not been thoroughly tested:
  - Potential bottlenecks with many concurrent sessions
  - LLM API calls can introduce latency
  - Memory usage may grow with active sessions

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Develop integration guides for common scenarios
   - Document deployment processes in detail

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement more robust authentication
   - Add rate limiting to protect against abuse
   - Enhance tool safety mechanisms

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - Add optional database integration for session persistence
   - Implement message history storage
   - Enable horizontal scaling support

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Implement structured logging throughout
   - Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
   - Create dashboards for system health visualization

5. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Enhance the web interface design
   - Add better visualization of agent thinking
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
